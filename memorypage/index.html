              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been to Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Ethiopia, conducted several
            expeditions to Egypt, and just recently returned from a trip to
            Syria and Lebanon. And everywhere they saw practically the same
            thing: the ancient civilizations known to us from school textbooks
            built their cities on the ruins of a much more ancient, and
            incomparably more highly developed, even more ancient civilization.
            And if we talk about “ancient cultures,” then distinctions can be
            made, for example, between the Egyptians and the Sumerians, the
            Mayans and the Incas. But the evidence that has come down to us from
            more ancient times points to a single culture, a single civilization
            (as I already mentioned) on a planetary scale!.. A civilization
            whose representatives lived here for at least several thousand
            years!..
